Goal:
Create a script using VBA in Excel to analyze stock data from 2017 to 2018.

Used for loops and conditionals to iterate through each row of data in 3 worksheets in a workbook to return the following:

Ticker symbol
Total volume of stock sold per ticker symbol
Annual change between the opening price at the beginning of the year and closing price at the end of the year per ticker symbol
Percent change between the opening price at the beginning of the year and closing price at the end of the year per ticker symbol
Ticker symbol with the greatest percent increase and its corresponding value
Ticker symbol with the greatest percent decrease and its corresponding value
Ticker symbol with the greatest total volume and its corresponding value
Also created a script to conditionally format the cell interiors of "Yearly Change"
