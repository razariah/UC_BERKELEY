Oversample
Lastly, you’ll write a brief summary and analysis of the models’ performance. 

Describe the precision and recall scores, as well as the balanced accuracy score. 

Additionally, include a final recommendation on the model to use, if any. 

If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.

Oversampling provides a little better precision on the prediction than the Undersampling 
The high risk precision score Logistic Regression has .51 balanced_accuracy score
The balanced accuracy score on the oversamnpling score is .65
oversampling the ave precision look ok but for high risk the results are low .01 less than satisfactory.  The recal rate is also low at .60
Both oversampling and undersampling models are inadequate because their precisioon on high risk is less than desired




Extension
the random forest classifier suggests 
balanced accduracy score says based on the testing .78 of the testing is accurate
