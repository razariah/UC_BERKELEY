### Oversample
* Oversampling provides a little better precision on the prediction than the Undersampling 
* The high risk precision score Logistic Regression has .51 balanced_accuracy score
* The balanced accuracy score on the oversamnpling score is .65
* Oversampling the average precision looked ok, but for high risk, the results are low .01 less than satisfactory.
* The recall rate is also low at .60

### Both oversampling and undersampling models are inadequate because their precisioon on high risk is less than desired

### Extension
#### The random forest classifier suggests 
* balanced accduracy score says based on the testing .78 of the testing is accurate
