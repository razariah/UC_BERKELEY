# Excel: Kickstarter

#### Goal:

Here a dataset of about 4,000 Kickstarter events were analyzed.  The purpose was to determine the relationship between length of running time and the success or failure of the event.  


#### Steps to Manage:

Initially all events were conditionally formated to determine the progress of the events. 

The calculations of average donation were listed and unix timestamps were converted tp standard formats.

Relationships of goal amounts, parent category, sub category and launch date were created using pivot tables and charts
