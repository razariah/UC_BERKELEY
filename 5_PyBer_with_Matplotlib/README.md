# Mod5_PyBer_Analysis

To deliver the results of your analysis, you will submit a written analysis created for your CEO, V. Isualize, in the form of a README.md file on your GitHub repository. In your README.md, you should have three paragraphs consisting of 4 to 5 sentences each.

##The purpose of the project was to compare ride sharing data bewteen urban, suburban and rural areas.

Data was analyzed to deliver technical deliverables through data manipulation, "groupby" and aggregation methods.

Based on the results of the summary DataFrame and multiple-line graphs with respect to the ride-sharing data among the different city types, 
the ride sharing increased dramatically in May for the Suburban ride sharing fees while both Rural and Urban showed gradual decreasing fares.
	
##A short summary of the results.

There were no substantial challenges encounted while evaluating ride sharing data gathered from rural, suburban or urban use patterns.  Clearly urban fares fetched a high value for the duration than rural. 

Based on the results, one might conclude that focusing on supporting urban ride sharing would be most profitable, while the fares for rural tended to be higher.  To supplement a balance in results, various incentives might be included.
Those riders in the rural and suburban areas spend more time in the vehcile.  Making sure to emphasize access to power to support their digital devices and possibly wifi might perk interest.  

Additionally, due to the long ride, a predesigned stop area for standard routes might be included for rest room or a snack break. Above all the types of vehicles offered for the longer rides should
 be more comfortable and spacious. The inclusion  of mixed type vehicles for suburban drivers would also be a great addition.  Urban drivers are not expected to be travaleing long distances and
 would therefore be less demanding of such luxuries.

A survey of what additional items are more appealing to long distance riders could be gentely included while the passengers are in route.  
For the cooperating passengers a small incentive such as a free cup of coffee or a small donation to a well known nonprofit could be a perk.

Making the experience as useful as possible for the rider would be something to seriously consider as time spent is time lost. Showing that the company has the greatest interest 
in providing the valuable resources during the ride at little expense to the company would be a great addition.
