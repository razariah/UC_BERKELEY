This project designs a UFO sighting Web site with dynamic filtering implmented using JavaScript/D3/HTML/CSS. The goal is to be albe to apply five filters (date, city, state, country, and shape) and dynamically update the table. 

The main javaScript program app.js includes 3 main functions:
1. buildTable - to create tbody using filtered data dynamically
2. updateFilters - update list of filter(s) or no-filtering based on form submission (on button click)
3. filterTable - filter data based on the list of filters generated by the 'updateFilters' function, and pass to the 'buildTable' function to build the table.

index.html is the main HTML template showing a neat web page using styles defined in Bootstrap.js and customr CSS (style.css). The html source calls data.js to load the UFO data first, then import D3.js (through CDN) library to handle selecting html elements, event handling, etc, and lastly call app.js to support filtering table.
