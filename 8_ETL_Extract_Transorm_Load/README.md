Module 8
Presents a cohesive written analysis that documents 5+ valid assumptions.

1. Based on the scatter plots and correlation involving box office, revenue, budget and release dates, we can assume that most of the movies in wiki are available in the kaggle dataset.
2. Based on the scatter plot involving wiki and kaggle budget, there are a very large portion of movies that are in kaggle that aren't in wiki and vice versa, or there are errors in box office and revenue which show a movie as close to $0.
3. With a few exceptions, just about every movie was released after 1985.
4. A majority of the films released less than $500M, several made over $500M but less than $1B, some movies reached up to $1.5B and very few grossed more, with one reaching almost $3B.
5. Just under 99% of all movies released were originally released in English.
